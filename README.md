Thanks to Eulerâ€™s formula, convolution of complex sine wave and contineous signal can be represented on complex plane. 

While the complex sine wave is still stationary which does not take the weight of time into account wavelet is non-stationary and also take the weight of time into account.

With images transformed through those three wavelets[[morse](https://kr.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ug/morse-wavelets.html), [gabor](https://kr.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ref/cwtft.html#bsy_h17), [bump](https://kr.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ref/cwtft.html#buu64ch)] , it is verified that AlexNet can detect abnormality in advertising dynamics.
